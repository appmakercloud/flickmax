# FlickMax Fixes - August 5, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines all the issues fixed on August 5, 2025, for the FlickMax domain reseller platform.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Save Badge Positioning in Cart Panel
**Problem**: The save badge was appearing inline with prices instead of below the sale price.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `PriceDisplay` component to properly handle inline vs block display
- Modified cart panel to use flex column layout with proper spacing
- Badge now appears below the sale price as intended

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/ui/PriceDisplay.tsx`
- `/components/cart/CartPanel.tsx`

### 2. Domain Pricing for Non-US Markets
**Problem**: Sale prices were only showing for US market. Other markets (INR, AED, etc.) only showed single prices without discounts.

**Solution**:
- Discovered that GoDaddy API returns sale prices only when using `marketId=en-US`
- Modified all API calls to use `marketId=en-US` with the appropriate currency
- Example: `currencyType=INR&marketId=en-US` returns correct sale prices

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/api/domain-service.ts`
- `/lib/api/domain.ts`
- `/components/cart/CartPanel.tsx`

### 3. Cart Items Disappearing After Page Refresh
**Problem**: When adding a new domain after page refresh, the domain would show as added but wouldn't appear in the cart panel.

**Root Causes**:
1. React hook dependencies were incorrect in `useCart`
2. Cart price updates were using stale state data
3. Race condition between cart refresh and price updates

**Solutions**:
1. Fixed useEffect dependencies and moved `fetchCart` definition before usage
2. Modified price update logic to fetch latest cart data from localStorage
3. Reset `previousCountry` state when cart opens to ensure price updates run

**Files Modified**:
- `/hooks/useCart.ts`
- `/components/cart/CartPanel.tsx`
- `/lib/api/client-cart.ts`

### 4. TypeScript and ESLint Errors
**Problem**: Vercel deployment was failing due to ESLint and TypeScript errors.

**Errors Fixed**:
- `prefer-const` warnings for variables that weren't reassigned
- `no-explicit-any` errors in domain service
- TypeScript index signature errors

**Solution**:
- Changed `let` to `const` where appropriate
- Created proper TypeScript interfaces (`DomainData`, `ApiResponse`)
- Added type-safe property access using `keyof` operator

**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/api/domain-service.ts`
- `/components/cart/CartPanel.tsx`

## Key Learnings

### GoDaddy API Behavior
- The API returns different pricing structures for different markets
- Sale prices are consistently returned only with `marketId=en-US`
- Currency can be changed independently of market ID

### Cart State Management
- Cart data must be fetched fresh before any updates to avoid stale state
- localStorage synchronization is critical for cart persistence
- Race conditions can occur between component effects

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Avoid using `any` type - create specific interfaces instead
- Use `as const` for literal arrays to improve type inference
- Index signatures should use specific union types rather than `any`

## API Endpoints Used

### Domain Search
```
/api/domain/search/exact?q={domain}&currencyType={currency}&marketId=en-US
```

### Important Notes
- Always use `marketId=en-US` for consistent pricing data
- The `currencyType` parameter controls the currency display
- Cart updates should use `clientCartService.updateCart()` for consistency

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Add domain in USD market
- [ ] Switch to different currency (INR, EUR, etc.)
- [ ] Verify sale prices show correctly
- [ ] Add another domain
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Verify all domains remain in cart
- [ ] Open cart panel
- [ ] Verify prices update for selected currency

## Future Considerations
1. Consider caching domain prices to reduce API calls
2. Implement optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
3. Add error recovery for failed price updates
