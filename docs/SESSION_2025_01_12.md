# Development Session - January 12, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing the home page services section to display real pricing fetched from product API endpoints instead of hardcoded values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Home Page Services Section - Real Pricing Integration
**Problem:** The home page services section was displaying hardcoded pricing instead of fetching real prices from the product APIs.

**Solution:** Created a new component `ModernServicesWithPricing` that dynamically fetches pricing from various product API endpoints.

#### Files Modified:
- **Created:** `/components/home/ModernServicesWithPricing.tsx`
  - New component that fetches real-time pricing from product APIs
  - Supports multiple currencies and markets
  - Includes loading states and fallback pricing
  - Fetches pricing for: SSL, Hosting, VPS, WordPress, Website Builder, Email, and Security products

- **Updated:** `/app/page.tsx`
  - Replaced `ModernServices` component with `ModernServicesWithPricing`
  - Now displays dynamic pricing based on user's selected currency/market

#### API Integration Details:
The component fetches pricing from the following endpoints:
- `/api/products/ssl` - SSL certificates (yearly pricing)
- `/api/products/vps-hosting` - VPS hosting plans
- `/api/products/wordpress-hosting` - Managed WordPress hosting
- `/api/products/website-builder` - Website builder plans
- `/api/products/professional-email` - Email hosting
- `/api/products/website-security` - Security products

**Note:** Web hosting pricing is hardcoded as there's no dedicated API endpoint for it.

### 2. Pricing Data Structure Mapping
Each API endpoint returns data in slightly different structures. The component handles these variations:
- SSL: `data.products[0].price.yearly`
- VPS: `plans.standard[0].monthlyPrice`
- WordPress: `plans[0].monthlyPrice`
- Website Builder: `plans[0].monthlyPrice`
- Email: `data.products[0].price.monthly`
- Security: `data.products[0].price.monthly`

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Pricing:** Fetches real prices based on selected currency and market
2. **Loading States:** Shows skeleton loaders while fetching prices
3. **Error Handling:** Falls back to default prices if API calls fail
4. **Currency Support:** Works with multiple currencies (USD, INR, EUR, GBP)
5. **Performance:** Fetches all prices in parallel for faster loading

### Code Example:
```typescript
// Fetch SSL pricing
const sslResponse = await fetch(`/api/products/ssl?currency=${currency}&market=${country.marketId}`)
const sslResult = await sslResponse.json()
const sslPrice = sslResult.data?.products?.[0]?.price?.yearly || 9.99
```

## Issues Resolved
1. Fixed incorrect data path extraction from API responses
2. Handled missing API endpoints (web-hosting) with fallback values
3. Corrected pricing display format with proper currency symbols
4. Added console logging for debugging API responses

## Testing Notes
- Tested with different currencies (USD, INR, EUR, GBP)
- Verified pricing updates when switching countries
- Confirmed fallback values work when APIs fail
- Checked loading states display correctly

## Future Improvements
1. Create a dedicated web-hosting API endpoint to avoid hardcoded pricing
2. Implement caching to reduce API calls
3. Add more detailed error handling and user feedback
4. Consider implementing a pricing service to centralize all pricing logic

## Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. The implementation uses existing packages:
- Next.js fetch API for data fetching
- Framer Motion for animations
- React hooks for state management
- Country context for currency/market selection

## Performance Impact
- Initial page load may be slightly slower due to API calls
- Subsequent navigation is unaffected
- API calls are made in parallel to minimize loading time

## Browser Compatibility
Tested and working in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Deployment Notes
- Environment variables remain unchanged
- No database migrations required
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with existing cart and checkout flow
