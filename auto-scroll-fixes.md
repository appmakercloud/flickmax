# Auto-Scroll Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Improved Scroll Positioning
**Problem**: The auto-scroll was scrolling too far down, not centering the results properly.

**Solution**: 
- Changed from `scrollIntoView` to custom `window.scrollTo` implementation
- Calculates the element position and positions it 1/4 from the top of viewport
- This provides better visibility of results without scrolling too far

**Code**:
```javascript
const element = searchResultsRef.current
const elementRect = element.getBoundingClientRect()
const absoluteElementTop = elementRect.top + window.pageYOffset
const middle = absoluteElementTop - (window.innerHeight / 4) // Position results 1/4 from top
        
window.scrollTo({
  top: middle > 0 ? middle : 0,
  behavior: 'smooth'
})
```

### 2. Fixed Background Height Issue
**Problem**: The section had a fixed `min-h-[750px]` which created extra space below results.

**Solution**:
- Made the minimum height conditional: only applies when no search results are shown
- Added conditional padding at the bottom when results are displayed
- This prevents the extra background space from appearing

**Code**:
```jsx
// Conditional min-height
<section className={`relative overflow-hidden ${!searchResults ? 'min-h-[750px]' : ''}`}>

// Conditional bottom padding
<div className={`... ${searchResults ? 'pb-8' : ''}`}>
```

## Result
- Search results now appear at a comfortable viewing position (1/4 from top of viewport)
- No extra background space appears below the results
- The initial page layout is preserved when no results are shown
- Smooth scrolling animation provides good UX

## Testing
1. Search for a domain
2. Results should appear with the main result positioned comfortably in view
3. No extra dark background should appear below the results
4. The page should maintain its original appearance before searching
